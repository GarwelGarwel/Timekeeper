# Timekeeper

This is a rather simple and unobtrusive mod that counts orbits and solar days (sols) for all your vessels in the background. It displays the current orbit/sol when you switch to the vessel or when the counter changes. It is purely cosmetic and is intended mostly for role-playing and immersion.

## Notes
- The mod starts counting orbits when the vessel achieves a stable orbit, i.e. has periapsis above ground and atmosphere and apoapsis within body's SOI. It keeps counting as your orbit changes, even if you go suborbital for a moment. If the vessel goes reaches escape velocity, lands/splashes down or exits SOI, the counterÂ stops.
- Sols are counted when the vessel lands or splashes down. Counting will continue as the vessel flies, drives or hops around unless it goes orbital or escapes SOI.
- Mod's impact on performance should be very small.
- You can disable orbits or sols counting or the mod altogether in the Settings.
- AVC and CKAN are supported for checking for updates.
